"# Ball-Calculator" 
The Cricket Ball Calculator is a simple tool that helps track overs in a cricket match. Every 6 balls bowled automatically increase the over count by 1. Users can:

* Add Ball → Increments the ball count, updating the overs accordingly.
* Reduce Ball → Decreases the ball count if needed.
* Reset → Clears the count to start fresh.
